# RFMwithKMeans

This Jupyter notebooks imports a publically available e-commerce data set and performs Recency, Frequency and Money analysis on sales transactions.  The RFM results are fed into K-means clustering as a way of segmenting or clustering similar customers together.  The intended audience for such analysis are sales and marketing teams so that customer campaigns can be targeted appropriately.  For example, frequent but non-recent customers may be loyal customers who are churning so incentive campaigns may help bring these customers back.
